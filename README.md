# ADAS Low Light Vision

**Object Detection and Distance Estimation for Low-Visibility Driving**

---

## Overview
This project implements an **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)** module focused on **object detection and distance estimation** under **low-light and poor visibility conditions**.  
The system processes video input to detect objects and estimate their distance in real time, improving driving safety during night-time or adverse weather scenarios.
