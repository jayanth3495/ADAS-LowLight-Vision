ADAS Low Light Vision

Object Detection and Distance Estimation for Low-Visibility Driving

Overview
This project implements an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) module focused on object detection and distance estimation under low-light and poor visibility conditions.
The system processes video input to detect objects and estimate their distance in real time, improving driving safety during night-time or adverse weather scenarios.\
